Population increase has been an ever-increasing problem. In a country like India, where population is rising at a rapid rate, problems associated with it also increases. Some of these problems include increased unemployment, limited availability of resources, overcrowding, etc. One such issue which is most commonly seen in cities is the overcrowding. One such case of overcrowding which is discussed here is with respect to Mumbai Suburban Railways. Mumbai local trains carries lakhs of passengers daily. Most of the population in Mumbai is dependent on local trains for commuting to their work places. Travelling in peak hours is the most difficult task that people of Mumbai face. Due to overcrowding, there has been many accidents reported in the last few years and the number is increasing. Hence, our research goes on designing a system which will tackle the above problem. The approach involves collecting GPS data of people who enter the railway platform. This data is used for visualizing, monitoring and crowd prediction and creating a level of warning to commuters.
